While completing my final project, I studied 38 Grey's Anatomy episodes for my study. I constructed 38 of my favorite episodes and researched information on these specific episodes. I first started my research by deciphering what year each episode came out. I then looked at what season each episode was released in. The seasons that the episodes were picked from were 1-17. Next, I started to research if the episodes chosen were women-led. I found that all the episodes were led and written by a woman. I next demonstrated the emotions I felt while watching these episodes. I decided whether the episodes made me happy, sad, scared, and excited. After, I decided on the effort I thought was put into these episodes. I rated the episode's efforts from 1-100. Next, I deciphered whether the episode expressed drama. I displayed this by saying yes or no. Lastly, I expressed the excitement the episodes made me feel. I rated my excitement from 1-100.
